# Dragonstruder-M175
## A toolhead for Lulzbot printers integrating a Dragon hotend with Lulzbot's M175 design.

### Aside from using a Dragon hotend instead of the Slice Engineering Mosquito, this design has several additional changes:
* Includes a mount point for a BLTouch bed leveling sensor
* Additional part-stiffening to minimize oscillation/resonance during fast moves in the X axis
* The entire extruder assembly has been shifted slightly closer to the X gantry (shortened) to decrease torsional load
* Integrated mount for a BLTouch bed leveling sensor
* Blower shroud has been minimally-modified to accomodate V6 heater block and extruder assembly repositioning. Cavities that route air are otherwise largely untouched so as to retain original flow characterisics as much as possible.   
* Blower mounting flange has been modified to aid in assembly
